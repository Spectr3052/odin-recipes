    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Brownies are a type of baked dessert that are typically made with chocolate and butter or oil, and often includes sugar, eggs, and flour. They are usually square or rectangular in shape and are known for their rich, chocolatey flavor and fudgy, dense texture. Brownies can be served either warm or cold, and they may be topped with frosting, nuts, or chocolate chips. They are often enjoyed as a sweet treat or dessert and are popular at parties and gatherings. There are many variations of brownies, including chocolate chip brownies, mint brownies, and brownies with nuts or other mix-ins.
